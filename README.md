This React.js [higher-order component
(HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) exists to provide
an appropriate wrapper for components that utilize
[forwarded refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html). It accepts a
`ref` via `props` and renames `ref` to `forwardedRef` along
with whatever other `props` are passed in.

Please see the [`API Documentation`](./API.md) for usage.
